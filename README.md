SNPs near splice sites


Check SNPs that are in both 3UTR and Coding in original LDSR paper (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-018-0081-4) to see where they splice to


To Run:

  1. Make a new directory on the MSU HPCC
  2. Clone this repo into it useing the following command:
  `git clone https://github.com/ACharbonneau/fuzzy-train.git`
  3. Run the script using the following command:
  `sh createsplicetable.sh`
  4. Download "both3UTR_Coding.splice.tsv" to your local computer and view it in Excel (or any other matrix software)
